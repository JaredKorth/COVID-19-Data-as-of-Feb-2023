COVID-19 Data Analysis in SQL
by Jared Korth

DESCRIPTION
A series of queries written in Microsoft SQL Server 2022 [using SQL Server Management Studio 19], exploring global data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was pulled in February 2023, just before Johns Hopkins University (a major compiler of COVID-19 statistics in the United States) ended their daily reporting.


CREDITS
Thanks to Our World In Data, who provide comprehensive and up-to-date pandemic data to the public, and all the entities from whom they themselves gather and compile the data.


NOTES
If you would like to run these queries, I've included a portion of the data I used to create the tables, edited to satisfy upload file size limits.
