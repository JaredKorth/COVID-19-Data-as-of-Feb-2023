COVID-19 Data Analysis in SQL
by Jared Korth

DESCRIPTION
A series of queries written in Microsoft SQL Server 2022 [using SQL Server Management Studio 19], exploring global data related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As I am an aspiring professional data analyst, this was completed with the intention of uploading it to an online portfolio; consequently, each query is preceded by a
--'Two hyphen comment' to describe the purpose of the query, and a 
---'Three hyphen comment' to note some of the techniques used in the query.


CREDITS
Thanks to Alex the Analyst, who has created an excellent series of videos demonstrating full, professional data analysis projects for those of us who have the skills, but not the experience. This project was [rather loosely] based on one of his tutorials.

Thanks to Our World In Data, who provide comprehensive and up-to-date pandemic data to the public, and all the entities from whom they themselves gather and compile the data.


NOTE
If you wish to make use of these queries yourself, the data I used is available as two .xlsx files accompanying this readme.txt.

Alternatively, you can download and format up-to-date data according to the links and steps taken in Alex the Analyst's video at https://youtu.be/qfyynHBFOsM. A significant portion of OWID's data set comes from Johns Hopkins University, who will stop reporting  later this week; query compatibility with later data sets is not guaranteed.

In either case, import the tables as 'mortality' and 'vaccinations' to use with the queries as they are.
